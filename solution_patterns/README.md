### NOTE: This README and all files in solution_patterns directory should be replaced with YOUR solution patterns

# Solution Patterns Directory

This directory contains documented patterns for common microservice integration challenges using progressive disclosure.

## Available Patterns

- **README.md** (This file) - Overview of solution patterns
- **sync-requests_2_async-workers.md** - Synchronous request to async worker pattern
- **customer-specific-registration.md** - Customer-specific registration flows
- **schema-updates.md** - Database schema update patterns

## Pattern Structure

Each pattern file should follow progressive disclosure principles:
- Start with high-level overview
- Provide step-by-step implementation details
- Include code examples and configurations
- Reference related patterns and skills

## Adding New Patterns

To add a new solution pattern:
1. Create a new .md file in this directory
2. Use descriptive naming with underscores
3. Follow progressive disclosure structure
4. Cross-reference with relevant skills
5. Update HARNESS_SCOPE.md when pattern is in scope
